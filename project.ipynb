    "### Irish Flower Dataset\n",
    "The Iris flower data set, otherwise known as Fishers Iris data set, is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistcian and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *\"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis\"* [2]. Multivariate statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the analysis of multiple variables at the same time [3]. It involves studying various types of multivariate analysis and their relationships with each other. This data set has since been widely used for pattern recognition and classification tasks in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and biology. Fisher's Iris data set is a well-known and widely used data set in the field of machine learning and statistics. It is a valuable resource for researchers in this field. Its simplicity and small size make it an ideal starting point for exploring classification algorithms and statistical techniques."

    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence [1]. It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that the input data consists of both input features and their corresponding correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen data based on the patterns and relationships learned from the labeled data. Supervised learning helps organisations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised leanring can be seperated into two types of problems when data mining [1]. They are classification and regression. Classifcation uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories [1]. It recognises specific patterns within the datasets and it tries to draw conclusions on how the patterns should be defined or labeled. Common classification algorithms are k-nearest neighbor, linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forest. All of these will be discussed in the following section. Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables [1]. Usually, it is used to make projections, such as the global temperature increases due to climate change. Popular regressions algorithms are as follows, linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression. Supervised learning has many advantages, such as deep data insights and improved automation. However, there are challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. These challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately [1].\n",
    "- Training the models can be very time intensive. \n",
    "- If there are faults in the dataset due to human error, it results in the algorithms learning incorrectly.\n",
    "- Supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own."
